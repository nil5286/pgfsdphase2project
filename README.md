FLYAWAY - FLIGHT BOOKING SYSTEM

Problem statement - 
FlyAway is a ticket-booking portal that lets people book flights on their website.

Objective – 
As a Full Stack Developer, design and develop an airline booking portal named as FlyAway. Use the GitHub repository to manage the project artifacts. 

● After User login, User is redirected to a search form to allow entry of travel details, like the source, destination, and the number of persons.
● Based on the travel details entered, it will show the available flights with their ticket prices.
● Once a person selects a flight to book, they will be taken to a register page where they must fill in their personal details. In the next page, they are shown the flight details of the flight that they are booking, and the payment is done via a dummy payment gateway. On completion of the payment, they are shown a confirmation page with the details of the booking. 
 
For the above features to work, there will be an admin backend with the following features:
● An admin login page where the admin can change the password after login, if he wishes.
● After Admin Logins it lists all the booked flight details.
